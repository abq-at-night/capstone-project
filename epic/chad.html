		<h3>User Persona</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Name:</b> Chad Bradley</li>
			<li><b>Age:</b> 26</li>
			<li><b>Gender: </b> Male</li>
			<li><b>Occupation:</b> Chad is a business major at UNM</li>
			<li><b>Technology:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Phone:</b> iPhone X running iOS 12</li>
				<li><b>Laptop:</b> MacBook OS 10.14</li>
			</ul>
			<li><b>Attitude: </b>  Chad is social, and goal oriented. He likes information at his fingertips, but does not like to wait for it. Chad likes live music and the dance club.</li>
			<li><b>Technology:</b> Chad loves his apple products and has an iPhone and Macbook. Chad also runs the chrome browser in both. He is very comfortable with the internet and social media.</li>
			<li><b>Frustrations and Needs: </b> Chad hates how hard it is to find interesting entertainment in Albuquerque. Chad dislikes slow/ unresponsive web pages, ugly pages with UI/UX problems, biased, targeted, or otherwise manipulated search results. Chad wants a search service that is responsive, unbiased, and modern.</li>
			<li><b>Goal: </b> It’s friday night, and chad is at a local bar with his friends. Chad would like to see what is going on in town later this evening. Chad hates using google because often, small events are left out. Outdated information or even irrelevant, keyword heavy “best things to do” and other touristy aggregate/list websites plague and clog up the search engine. Local websites such as the alibi are feature bloated, unfocused, ad riddled, and sports unfriendly UI design and sluggish response. Chad has been using facebook as his main way to receive information about local events, but does not like the social integration, as it feels prying, “data hordish”, and insecure, and for some reason requires his personal information to work.
				<br><br>“Why does everything need access to my personal data to work? What happened to the days when websites were just tools?” he thinks to himself as he downs another domestic. Luckily, he recently saw a poster for a website that advertises fast simple searches of local events and music, called ABQ@Night. Chad is intrigued and visits the website. He notices the “I’m feeling adventurous” feature which shows him what events are happening close by tonight. He clicks on a event post that looks interesting, and quickly plans the rest of his evening with his friends.
