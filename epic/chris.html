		<h1>User Persona</h1>
		<img src="persona-chris-martinez.jpg" alt="Picture of Chris Martinez"/>
				<h3>Name</h3>
					<p>Christina Martinez</p>
				<h3>Age</h3>
					<p>26 years old</p>
				<h3>Location</h3>
					<p>McDuffie Place, Albuquerque, New Mexico</p>
				<h3>Occupation</h3>
					<p>Christina (or "Chris" as everyone calls her) is a reference librarian at the Cherry Hills branch library. She has a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree from Simmons College and has been with the Albuquerque Public Library for two years.</p>
				<h3>Technology</h3>
					<p>Chris had the opportunity to take an introduction to HTML and CSS course while working on her master's degree, so she is very comfortable with computers. At work, she uses a 2016 Dell XPS 8900 Desktop that runs on Windows 10 Pro. The smartphone she recently purchased is an LG G6 with Android 7.0. Additionally, her personal laptop is a 13-inch 2017 MacBook Air, on which she installed macOS Mojave a few weeks ago.</p>
				<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>
					<p>Chris has loved house and techno since she was a teenager in Chicago, but ever since she and her spouse started their careers, they haven't gone out clubbing very much.<p>
					<p>Recently, Chris and her wife have had a desire to start going out again on the weekends. However, in spite of Chris's superior research skills, she has found the experience of searching for DJs and local night clubs to be a bothersome activity. Looking through local venues' calendars takes up too much of her free time, so she and her spouse end up spending weekends at home more often than not.</p>
				<h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
					<p>When Chris and her wife first moved to Albuquerque, they picked up a few copies of the Alibi and then eventually started using the paper's website. Chris in particular was put-off by the website's poor aesthetic qualities and the calendar section, which only allows users to search by dates. The quality of indivdual venues' websites varies, but Chris finds searching through them to be too time-consuming to be worth the trouble. She would love to have a website or application that lists all upcoming musical events that is both easy to navigate and pleasing to the eye. If the site/app could be easily accessed via mobile, she and her wife would be even happier.</p>
				<h3>Goals</h3>
					<p>Chris and her spouse feel comfortable in their careers now and really want to revive their old passion for clubbing. They need a resource that will make it easy to find events by date, genre, venue, artist, and possibly promoter. As they both have errands to run and various activities that take up their weekend mornings and afternoons (on top of their jobs and obligations during the work week), they need something that can be accessed on-the-go to make evening planning easier.</p>
