        <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
            <p>It’s early Friday evening and after a long work week, you’re finally able to meet up with your friends for a night out. As               dinner winds down, you begin formulating a plan for the rest of the evening. Someone suggests that you all go check out a                show, and everyone voices their approval. You all pull out your mobile phones and begin searching for local concerts and                 musical events. The only problems are that the event websites’ layouts are cumbersome and the search options are extremely               limited. You think that perusing each individual venue’s website might be a better solution, but that option quickly                     proves to be too time-consuming. After fifteen minutes of frustration, you all abandon the concert idea and resignedly opt               for a movie instead.</p>
            <p>It shouldn’t be that difficult to search for a live music event, and in fact, it no longer has to be. The new website ABQ                at Night has been created to make planning a musical night out as fun and stress-free as the events themselves. Our site                 offers users a range of options for searching, from simple queries to filtering by date, artist, genre, venue, and                       promoter. Site visitors will be delighted with the intuitive navigation, uncluttered design, and eye-catching yet elegant                features such as the ability to swipe away the digital “cards” on which event information is listed. Users will be able to               share their plans on social media, easily add them to their Google calendars, and launch their map application to locate                 the venue, but the site’s design won’t be marred by comment threads, ratings, or “likes”. Additionally, our more                         spontaneous users will have the option to click the “I’m Feeling Adventurous” button that will allow them to see all of                  today’s events and select one to attend (just don’t hesitate for more than a few seconds, though, or the event card will                 disappear and another one will take its place).</p>
            <p>Albuquerque is a dynamic city with a thriving music scene, and Burqueños deserve a better concert-planning experience. ABQ               at Night aims to take the aggravation out of the equation and allow users to focus on what matters: creating shared                      memories around live music.</p>
